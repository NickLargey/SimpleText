We think that these changes might be different things because: (1) the small connection between how much muscle gets bigger and how strong it gets after exercising; (2) muscles get smaller when you stop exercising, but your strength stays the same; and (3) muscles grow the same amount with low-weight and high-weight exercises, but the results in strength are different.	We suggest that these changes may be completely separate phenomena based on: (1) the weak correlation between the change in muscle size and the change in muscle strength after training; (2) the loss of muscle mass with detraining, yet a maintenance of muscle strength; and (3) the similar muscle growth between low-load and high-load resistance training, yet divergent results in strength.

In simple words, stretching gently does not make your muscles bigger or change their shape. However, stretching with some tension, especially when you are lifting weights or doing it between muscle contractions, might help your muscles grow.	In conclusion, passive, low-intensity stretch does not appear to confer beneficial changes in muscle size and architecture; alternatively, albeit limited evidence suggests that when stretching is done with a certain degree of tensile strain (particularly when loaded, or added between active muscle contractions) may elicit muscle hypertrophy.

As such, if there is a problem with the conspiracy theorists use of evidence, it is one of principle: is the principle which guides their use of evidence somehow in error?

With the introduction of memory-bound cryptocurrencies, such as Monero, the implementation of mining code in browser-based JavaScript has become a worthwhile alternative to dedicated mining rigs.	Memory-bound cryptocurrencies like Monero can be mined  from a browser with JavaScript, better than with a dedicated rig.	{'rouge1': 0.3684210526315789, 'rouge2': 0.1111111111111111, 'rougeL': 0.3684210526315789, 'rougeLsum': 0.3684210526315789}
We don't gather big groups of information this time. Instead, we get smaller groups with a few hundred pictures each. We then change the CNN (a type of computer program) that learns from UR robots to work with a new robot that looks and appears differently.	However, instead of collecting large datasets once again, we collect a number of smaller datasets containing a few hundred frames each and use transfer learning techniques on the CNN trained on UR robots to adapt it to a new robot having different shapes and visual features.

We found big differences between the patterns of how drugs work and the patterns of other compounds tested for their effects.

Entropy is a way to measure how mixed or unpredictable something is. We can find it by breaking down stock market indexes from four big countries: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States.	The entropy is derived using singular value decomposition of the components of stock market indices in financial markets from selected developed economies, i.e., France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
